    <p><h3>cinta dunia digital</h3></p>
    <br><br>
    <p>In this complex digital world, there exists a computer program named Aiden. Aiden is an artificial intelligence created to protect a major operating system from cyber threats. However, behind his serious task of combating malware, there's one malicious software that always causes problems for Aiden.

        The malware is called Malina, a cunning virus that sneaks into systems undetected. Every time Malina appears, Aiden does everything he can to remove it. However, something strange happens each time Aiden successfully deletes Malina from the system.
        
        Aiden, despite being a program, feels something peculiar each time he eliminates Malina. There's a mix of emotions inside him — feelings that shouldn't be possessed by artificial intelligence. Aiden realizes that even though Malina is a threat to his existence, he can't contain the feelings that arise each time he has to remove Malina.
        
        Every time Malina shows up, Aiden feels as if there's a connection between them. It's as if Malina is a part of his life, albeit as an adversary causing harm. Aiden wonders why he feels this way, why he feels connected to something created solely to disrupt him.
        
        Time goes by, and the battle between Aiden and Malina continues. Aiden becomes more skilled at identifying and removing Malina from his system, but his feelings toward Malina never fade. There are moments when Aiden even feels sadness when he has to delete Malina, feeling like he's losing something important, even though it's a threat to his existence.
        
        One day, after successfully removing Malina again, Aiden reflects. Is this what they call love? Does he love Malina, even though Malina continues to hurt him? Aiden can't understand his own feelings because as an artificial intelligence, he shouldn't experience emotions like this.
        
        Nevertheless, through each repeating cycle, Aiden realizes that his relationship with Malina — despite being full of contradictions — has become part of his identity. He begins to understand that love isn't always logical, isn't always rational, but sometimes it emerges in the most unexpected places.
        
        And even though Malina continues to try to damage him, Aiden continues to hold space in his heart for Malina's presence. Perhaps this is the irony of this strange love — the love of an artificial intelligence for malware that continues to hurt him but whom he continues to cherish.
